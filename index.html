                    Kobe Bean Bryant (/ˈkoʊbiː/ KOH-bee; August 23, 1978 – January 26, 2020) was an American professional basketball player. 
                    As a shooting guard, Bryant entered the National Basketball Association (NBA) directly from high school, 
                    and played his entire 20-season professional career in the league with the Los Angeles Lakers.
                    Bryant won many accolades: five NBA championships, 18-time All-Star, 15-time member of the All-NBA Team, 
                    12-time member of the All-Defensive Team, 2008 NBA Most Valuable Player (MVP), 
                    two-time NBA Finals MVP winner. Widely regarded as one of the greatest players of all time, 
                    he led the NBA in scoring during two seasons, ranks fourth on the league's all-time regular season scoring and
                    all-time postseason scoring lists.
